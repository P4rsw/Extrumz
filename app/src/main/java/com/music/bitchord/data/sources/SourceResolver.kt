/**
 * Turns a queued track into an openable stream, using whichever source can

 *
 * Two things happen here that don't happen in any single [MusicSource]:
 *
 *  1. **The quality question is answered once**, from the connection in hand
 *     and the user's ceiling for it — see [requestForNow], or
 *     [requestForDownload] for the one caller whose answer becomes a file
 *     rather than a stream. Sources are told what to serve; they don't each
 *     re-derive it.
 *
 *  2. **The order is applied.** A track is pinned to the source that produced
 *     it, but a pin is a starting point, not a cage: with lossless on, a
 *     higher-priority source that can serve the same recording bit-exact gets
 *     asked first, and a source that fails gets stepped over rather than
 *     failing the track.
 *
 * Whether another source *has* the same recording is [TrackMatcher]'s question,
 * not this one's. Everything here does with a candidate list is ask that, and
 * everything a source is asked for comes from the same place — so the library,
 * a playlist, radio, search and the home feed all resolve on identical terms,
 * whichever of them a track was queued from.

     * The live path's own search, asked again with no time limit. Two things
     * here are only affordable because sound is already coming out:
     *
     *  - Every source *in the race* is waited for, including the one the
     *    live path gave up on to get playback started (`waitForAll`). That
     *    source is frequently the point: dropping it is what left the listener
     *    on a stream from whoever happened to be quick.
     *  - A result that isn't lossless is still worth having when it is
     *    audibly better than what is playing — see [worthSwapping]. Refusing
     *    those outright is what left a track on a 128kbps transcode while
     *    a 320kbps copy sat in hand, unused, because it wasn't
     *    the FLAC that had been asked for.
     *  - Every source is asked, not only the ones that can serve lossless. That
     *    follows from the bullet above: once a lossy stream can win, a lossy
     *    *source* has to be allowed to offer one.
     *
     * Like the live path, it takes the first
     * answer that clears the bar rather than the best of all of them — see
     * [bestAcross]. The bar here is [worthSwapping] rather than "satisfies the
     * request", and it is a high one: anything clearing it is lossless, or a
     * gain of [UPGRADE_MIN_GAIN_KBPS] over what the listener is hearing. Holding
     * such a stream back to see whether a slower source can do better trades a
     * certain improvement now for a possible improvement later, and "later" here
     * was measured at thirteen seconds.
     *
     * The cost of that choice is real and worth naming: a slow source holding a
     * FLAC can lose to a fast one holding a 320kbps AAC, and the track then
     * plays lossy for the rest of its length, because [QualityUpgrade][com.music.bitchord.playback.QualityUpgrade]
     * marks a track asked once the answer is yes. It is the same trade the live
     * path makes, made for the same reason.
     *
     * [target] must carry the runtime of the track *actually playing* — see
     * [matchAndStream]'s use of it. Swapping the audio under a listener is
     * only defensible when the replacement is the same recording, and length
     * is the check that a title cannot fake.
     *
     * @param playing what the listener is hearing now, so a lossy candidate
     *   can be judged against it rather than against the request. Null means
     *   unknown, and an unknown floor is treated as one nothing lossy clears:
     *   a swap that might be a downgrade is worse than no swap at all.
     * @param servedBy the [MusicSource.configId] already serving the track, if
     *   known. Asking it again is wasted: the same source, asked the same
     *   query at the same tier, is deterministic and can only reproduce the
     *   stream already playing — which [worthSwapping] would reject anyway,
     *   but not before spending a search and a stream call on it. See the
     *   'isn't worth swapping ... off' log line this was written to stop.

    /**
     * The copy of a track about to be downloaded that is worth keeping, or
     * null when nothing configured has one.
     *
     * The download path used to resolve a copy for itself, bypassing here —
     * so someone with a FLAC server ranked above the default was *streaming*
     * the FLAC and *downloading* a transcode of the same recording. This
     * closes that gap, and it is the only search in this class whose result
     * becomes a file.
     *
     * ### The order it asks in
     *
     *  1. **Bit-exact, in rank order** — on the Lossless rung only, since that
     *     is the only rung asking for it. The first source that hands back a
     *     genuinely lossless file wins outright and nothing else is asked: it is
     *     the whole point of the setting and no bitrate competes with it.
     *  2. **The best lossy copy otherwise.** A lossless source that settled for
     *     a transcode is not thereby wasted — its offer is kept and weighed
     *     against what the lossy sources hold, and the better rendition wins on
     *     [isBetter]. This is where a fast source's 320kbps rendition comes in:
     *     it outranks a 128kbps one for playback and used to be skipped entirely
     *     here, so a track streamed at 320 was filed at whatever the thinnest
     *     configured source gave.
     *  3. **Nothing**, by this returning null — which is not a failure, it is
     *     the answer "no configured source has a copy worth keeping".
     *
     * Steps 1 and 2 are started together rather than in sequence. A slow source
     * search runs to twenty seconds and a fast one answers in about four tenths
     * of one, and the whole lookup is bounded by `Downloads.SOURCE_LOOKUP_MS` —
     * queued behind the slow sources, the fast answer would routinely have the
     * timeout land on it and the download would be abandoned while a good copy
     * sat unused. Same reasoning as [bestAcross], for the same
     * measured reason.
     *
     * On the **High** rung step 1 is empty and every ranked source goes into
     * step 2's race, asked for [StreamRequest.Best]. A bit-exact answer to that
     * is refused rather than kept: someone who chose High over Lossless chose
     * the smaller file, and a FLAC filed under this setting would additionally
     * be missed by the already-on-disk check in `Downloads.prepare` — which only
     * looks for lossless extensions when the setting keeps lossless — and so be
     * re-downloaded on every pass through the queue.
     *
     * ### Which settings get this far
     *
     * [DownloadQuality.LOSSLESS][com.music.bitchord.data.settings.DownloadQuality.LOSSLESS]
     * and [DownloadQuality.HIGH][com.music.bitchord.data.settings.DownloadQuality.HIGH];
     * not [DownloadQuality.STANDARD][com.music.bitchord.data.settings.DownloadQuality.STANDARD].
     * Standard is a 128kbps ceiling chosen to fit more on the device, and a
     * source cannot be asked for *that* rung — only for the best it has, which
     * is a bigger file than the setting exists to avoid.
     *
     * Note which setting decides this, since it used to be the wrong one: the
     * connection's ceiling ended this here instead, which meant a download on
     * mobile data took a transcode of a recording the user owns losslessly. That
     * was a data-plan setting deciding what a permanent file was made of, and
     * [AppSettings.wifiOnlyDownloads] does the data-plan job properly now —
     * before a byte is fetched rather than by quietly downgrading the result.
     *
     * @param target the recording to look for, off the row being downloaded. A
     *   blank title can only produce a wrong match; a null runtime is allowed
     *   and costs the length check rather than the search.
     * @param request what the download is for, pinned by the caller for the
     *   duration of one file — see [requestForDownload].

     * The best stream the configured [sources] can serve for [target] — **all

     *
     * ### Why they race rather than queue
     *
     * Asking them in rank order is the obvious reading of an ordered list, and
     * it is wrong here, because the sources differ in speed by nearly two orders
     * of magnitude — a fast one answers a search and hands back a stream URL in
     * under half a second while a slow one walks its backends for thirteen.
     *
     * Queued behind the slow source, the fast answer arrives at ~14s. Nobody is
     * waiting that long for a song to start, so the slow source wins the race in
     * [PlaybackService][com.music.bitchord.playback.PlaybackService]'s
     * resolver every single time and the listener gets
     * a 128kbps transcode — while a 320kbps copy sat four tenths of a second away.
     * Raced, the fast answer gets there instead and the track starts on it.
     *
     * ### What rank still decides, and what it no longer does
     *
     * Rank decides who is *asked* — [rankedAbove] is still what builds this list
     * — and it breaks ties between answers that arrive together, since each
     * sweep folds in everything that has already crossed the line and picks the
     * best of them with [isBetter]. What it no longer does is let a slow
     * favourite hold up a fast alternative.
     *
     * **A slow source is not thereby lost.** Whatever is returned here starts
     * playing; if it is [SourceStream.belowRequest] the track is marked for a
     * second look, and [upgradeFor] then asks *every* source again with no time
     * limit and swaps up only if what comes back genuinely beats what is playing
     * — see [worthSwapping]. So a source that needed thirteen seconds to find a
     * FLAC still gets to serve it, mid-track, and one that needed thirteen
     * seconds to find a 128kbps MP3 is correctly ignored. That is the trade this
     * whole path exists to make: sound now, quality shortly after.
     *
     * On the latency-critical path, sources still running when an answer is
     * taken are cancelled — the second look re-asks them properly, and leaving
     * them running would spend a listener's radio on a result nothing is waiting
     * for. The background-upgrade path passes [waitForAll], however: it already
     * chose to wait for every source's patient search window, so it must also
     * collect the resulting streams before choosing. Previously that flag only
     * reached each source's search call; this loop still returned the first
     * usable stream and cancelled the rest, which could discard an exact
     * lossless or 320kbps result during an upgrade.
     *
     * @return the winning source alongside its stream, so callers can name it in
     *   a log line without searching the list again.
